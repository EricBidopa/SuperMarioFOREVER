# SuperMario-ReMade

### This is a remake of the Super Mario Bros game. I hope you like it.

2. First download  and install SFML library.

3. You need a c++ compiler also.

4. clone tshi repo and run the multiple cpp files into one executable with g++ *.cpp -std=c++17 -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o mario.

5. type ./mario into the terminal to begin the game.



reference: this is a remake and not the original, I learnt this from a tutorial :)

# Cheers!
